# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data-Course_Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data in the Coursera Data Science Specialization

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ones ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repository will contain the following items:
1) A tidy data set as described by the following steps:
* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
* From the data set produced in the previous step, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each  activity and each subject

2) A link to the Github repository with respective script for performing the analysis
3) A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data
